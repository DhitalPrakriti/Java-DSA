# Weighted Graph Shortest Path

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path and total distance between cities in a weighted graph.

## Features
- Represent cities as nodes and distances as edges in a graph.
- Calculate the shortest path and total distance using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## How to Run
1. Compile and run `Assignment5.java`.
2. The program calculates the shortest path between "Olympia" and "Denver" based on predefined data.

## Sample Output
